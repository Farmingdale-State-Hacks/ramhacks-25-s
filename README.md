## 4. Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the RamHacks '25 website on your local machine.

### 4.1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: The project requires a recent version of Node.js.
    *   🔍 **Check version:** `node -v`
    *   The project recommends the latest stable version (e.g., `node:22-bullseye-slim` in Dockerfile). It's best to use `nvm install` if you have `.nvmrc` support, or install Node.js v20+.
*   **Bun**: The preferred package manager and JavaScript runtime for this project.
    *   🔍 **Check version:** `bun -v`
    *   **Installation:** `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
*   **Docker & Docker Compose**: Essential for running the PostgreSQL database locally.
    *   🔍 **Check versions:** `docker -v`, `docker compose -v`
    *   **Installation:** [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### 4.2. Installation & Setup

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Installation Steps</summary>

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Farmingdale-State-Hacks/ramhacks-25-s.git
    cd ramhacks-25-s
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as its package manager.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    ✅ **Success Note:** This might take a few moments. `bun` will install all required Node.js packages.

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and update it with your local configurations.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open `.env` in your editor and fill in the necessary values.
    ⚠️ **Important:** At a minimum, you'll need to set `DATABASE_URL` and potentially `SENTRY_DSN` if you want local Sentry integration. For local development, the `DATABASE_URL` can point to your local Dockerized PostgreSQL instance.
    ```env
    # .env example (fill these values)
    NODE_ENV=development
    VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ramhacks_db"
    # Example Sentry Config (optional for local dev)
    SENTRY_DSN=""
    SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=""
    SENTRY_ORG=""
    SENTRY_PROJECT=""
    SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
    ```

4.  **Start the local PostgreSQL database:**
    We use `docker-compose` to spin up a PostgreSQL instance.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d db
    ```
    This command starts the `db` service defined in `docker-compose.yml` in detached mode.
    💡 **Tip:** To verify the database is running, you can use `docker compose logs db` or `docker ps`. The `db` service runs on port `5432`.

5.  **Run Drizzle migrations:**
    After setting your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and starting the database, push the database schema using Drizzle Kit. This creates the tables defined in your schema.
    ```bash
    bun run db:push
    ```
    If you're starting fresh, you can also consider `bun run db:generate` to create new migration files, but `db:push` applies the current schema directly.
    🔍 **Verification:** You can connect to your local PostgreSQL instance (e.g., using `psql`, DBeaver, or another SQL client) with the credentials from your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` to confirm tables are created.

</details>

### 4.3. Configuration

The application's configuration is managed through a combination of files:

*   **`.env`**: For environment-specific variables (database credentials, API keys, Sentry DSN, etc.). This file is **not** committed to version control.
*   **`config/config.ts`**: For application-wide, non-sensitive configurations that are part of the codebase.
*   **`app.config.ts`**: TanStack Start's specific configuration, including Vite plugins, React Compiler, Sentry setup, and PWA options.
*   **`drizzle.config.ts`**: Drizzle ORM configuration for database migrations and schema management.

**Important Environment Variables:**

*   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `development` for local development, `production` for deployments.
*   `VITE_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the frontend. Default: `http://localhost:3000`.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for your PostgreSQL database (e.g., `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database`).
*   `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT`: Sentry configuration for error monitoring. These are crucial for production environments.

### 4.4. Running the Application

## 5. Usage & Workflows

This section outlines common commands and workflows for developing and managing the RamHacks '25 website.

### 5.1. Common Development Commands

The `package.json` defines several useful scripts to streamline development:

*   **`bun run dev`**:
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    Starts the development server with hot-reloading. Essential for active development.

*   **`bun run build`**:
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```
    Creates a production-ready build of the application. This generates optimized static assets and server-side code.

*   **`bun run start`**:
    ```bash
    bun run start
    ```
    Serves the production build. Use this after `bun run build` to run the application in a production-like environment.

*   **`bun run test`**:
    ```bash
    bun run test
    ```
    Runs all tests (Playwright and Cypress). This command acts as a wrapper for the different testing suites.
    See also: [Testing Strategy](#74-testing-strategy)

*   **`bun run test:e2e`**:
    ```bash
    bun run test:e2e
    ```
    Specifically runs the Playwright end-to-end tests.

*   **`bun run test:e2e:ui`**:
    ```bash
    bun run test:e2e:ui
    ```
    Opens the Playwright UI for interactive test debugging.

*   **`bun run cypress:open`**:
    ```bash
    bun run cypress:open
    ```
    Opens the Cypress Test Runner UI, allowing you to select and run individual Cypress tests or suites.

*   **`bun run cypress:run`**:
    ```bash
    bun run cypress:run
    ```
    Runs all Cypress tests headlessly in the command line (useful for CI/CD).

*   **`bun run format`**:
    ```bash
    bun run format
    ```
    Formats all code files using Prettier according to the `.prettierrc` configuration. This helps maintain consistent code style.

*   **`bun run lint`**:
    ```bash
    bun run lint
    ```
    Runs ESLint to analyze the code for potential errors and style violations.

### 5.2. Database Management

The project uses Drizzle ORM for database interactions and migrations.

*   **`bun run db:push`**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:push
    ```
    Pushes the current schema defined in `lib/server/schema/index.ts` to the connected database. This is useful for quickly synchronizing the schema during local development.
    ⚠️ **Warning:** Be cautious using `db:push` in production, as it can be destructive if not used correctly. It's generally preferred to use explicit migrations (`db:migrate`) for production environments.

*   **`bun run db:generate`**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:generate --name your-migration-name
    ```
    Generates a new Drizzle migration file based on the differences between your schema and the current database state. The `--name` flag is important for descriptive migration names. These files are typically stored in the `.drizzle` directory.

*   **`bun run db:migrate`**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:migrate
    ```
    Applies all pending migration files from the `.drizzle` directory to the database. This is the recommended way to manage schema changes in production.

### 5.3. UI Component Management

The project leverages `shadcn/ui` for its UI components. These components are automatically configured via `components.json`.

*   **Adding a new `shadcn/ui` component:**
    ```bash
    bun run ui:add button # Example: adds the Button component
    ```
    This command uses the `npx shadcn-ui@latest add` utility to download and configure a specified component into your `lib/components/ui` directory, following the settings in `components.json`.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the `ramhacks-25-s` repository to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ramhacks-25-s.git
    cd ramhacks-25-s
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch:** Always create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/your-bug-fix-name
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or fix the bug.
5.  **Test Your Changes:** Ensure your changes work as expected and don't introduce regressions. Run relevant tests (see [Testing Strategy](#74-testing-strategy)).
6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification (e.g., `feat: add new schedule page`, `fix: correct typo in FAQ`).
    The project uses `git-conventional-commits.yaml` for validation.
7.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
8.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the original `ramhacks-25-s` repository on GitHub.
    *   You should see a prompt to open a PR from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Fill out the PR template thoroughly, describing your changes, their purpose, and any relevant details.
    *   Link to any related issues.

### 7.2. Branching & Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Main Branch:** The `main` branch is always considered stable and deployable. All new features and bug fixes should be developed in separate branches.
*   **Branch Naming:**
    *   `feature/descriptive-name`: For new features.
    *   `bugfix/descriptive-name`: For bug fixes.
    *   `chore/descriptive-name`: For maintenance tasks, build process changes, etc.
    *   `docs/descriptive-name`: For documentation updates.
*   **Pull Request Reviews:** All PRs require at least one approval from a maintainer before merging. Address any feedback provided during the review process.
*   **CI/CD Checks:** Ensure all GitHub Actions (tests, linting, build) pass successfully on your PR before requesting a review.

### 7.3. Code Style & Quality

*   **ESLint:** We use ESLint for static code analysis to catch common errors and enforce coding standards.
    *   Run `bun run lint` before committing to identify and fix issues.
*   **Prettier:** Code formatting is handled by Prettier to ensure consistent style across the entire codebase.
    *   Run `bun run format` before committing. Your IDE might also integrate Prettier on save.
*   **TypeScript:** All new code should be written in TypeScript, leveraging its type-safety benefits.
*   **Component Structure:** Follow the existing component structure within `lib/components` and `app/routes`. Keep components small, focused, and reusable.

### 7.4. Testing Strategy

The project has a robust testing suite to ensure high quality and prevent regressions.

*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   **Playwright:** Used for broad E2E test coverage, located in the `e2e/` directory.
        *   Run `bun run test:e2e` for headless execution.
        *   Run `bun run test:e2e:ui` for interactive UI mode.
    *   **Cypress:** Also used for E2E testing, particularly for specific user flows and component interactions, located in the `cypress/` directory.
        *   Run `bun run cypress:run` for headless execution.
        *   Run `bun run cypress:open` to launch the Cypress Test Runner.
*   **Unit/Integration Testing:** While not explicitly detailed in `package.json` scripts, individual components and utility functions should ideally have dedicated unit tests (e.g., using `@testing-library/react` with a test runner like `Vitest` or `Jest`). You can find examples in `TESTING.md` (if it exists and is detailed).

💡 **Important:** Always run `bun run test` (or specific test suites) before submitting a Pull Request to ensure your changes haven't broken existing functionality.

### 7.5. Development Environment Setup

*   **Docker Compose for Database:** The `docker-compose.yml` provides a quick way to set up a local PostgreSQL instance. Always ensure it's running (`docker compose up -d db`) before starting the dev server or running migrations.
*   **IDE Configuration:** Ensure your IDE (e.g., VS Code) has ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript extensions installed and configured to use the project's settings. `.editorconfig` helps ensure consistent indentation and line endings.
*   **Node Version Manager (NVM):** If you manage multiple Node.js versions, use `nvm install` and `nvm use` in the project directory based on the `.nvmrc` file to ensure you're using the correct Node.js version.

### 9.3. Troubleshooting Guide

<details>
<summary>Click to expand common troubleshooting steps</summary>

*   **"bun: command not found"**:
    *   **Solution:** Ensure Bun is properly installed and its executable path is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. Refer to Bun's official installation guide.
*   **Database Connection Issues (`DATABASE_URL` errors)**:
    *   **Check `.env`**: Verify that `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in your `.env` file and matches the credentials in `docker-compose.yml`.
    *   **Docker Container Status**: Ensure your PostgreSQL container is running: `docker ps`. If not, start it with `docker compose up -d db`.
    *   **Port Conflicts**: Make sure no other application is using port `5432` on your machine.
    *   **Firewall**: Check if your firewall is blocking connections to `localhost:5432`.
*   **"Error: bun install failed" / Dependency Issues**:
    *   **Clean Cache**: Try clearing Bun's cache: `bun cache clean`.
    *   **Node.js Version**: Ensure you are using the recommended Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc` (`nvm use`).
    *   **Delete `node_modules`**: Remove the `node_modules` directory and `bun.lockb`, then run `bun install` again.
*   **UI Not Updating / Hot Reloading Issues**:
    *   **Restart Dev Server**: Sometimes, simply restarting `bun run dev` can resolve these issues, especially after significant dependency changes.
    *   **Check Browser Console**: Look for errors in your browser's developer console.
*   **Cypress/Playwright Tests Not Running**:
    *   **Ensure Dev Server is Running**: E2E tests require the application to be running first (`bun run dev`).
    *   **Browser Launch Issues**: For Cypress/Playwright UI, check if the required browser binaries are installed and accessible.
    *   **Console Output**: Review the console output from the test runner for specific error messages.

### 9.4. API Reference

The RamHacks '25 website leverages a minimal set of API routes, primarily for health checks and potential future dynamic content.

*   **Health Check Endpoint:**
    *   **URL:** `/api/health`
    *   **Method:** `GET`
    *   **Description:** A simple endpoint to check the operational status of the backend API. Returns a success message and server timestamp.
    *   **Example Response (200 OK):**
        ```json
        {
          "status": "ok",
          "message": "API is healthy",
          "timestamp": "2024-07-20T12:00:00.000Z"
        }
        ```
Further API endpoints will be documented here as they are developed for features like registration, project submission, etc. For now, most data is fetched directly via TanStack Query's server-side functions.
